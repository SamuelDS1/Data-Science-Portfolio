## [Project 1: Predicting Employees Churn](https://github.com/SamuelDS1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Projects/Project%201:%20Employees%20Churn) 
Employee churn, the phenomenon of employees leaving an organization, poses significant challenges for businesses in terms of productivity, morale, and financial implications. By leveraging the power of data, I have created a predictive model that effectively forecasts the likelihood of employees leaving a company.
Through data analysis, I have identified key factors that contribute to employee attrition, such as job satisfaction and compensation. By using decision trees, and random forests, I have developed a model that can anticipate employees churn with **90% precision**.

### Problem to solve
The objective is to predict employees churn so we can reduce it and save money to the company; we want to know what are the characteristics of employees that are most likely to quit.


### Analysis
After cleaning the data the analysis revealed that there's a 16% churn rate.

Further investigation shows that most employees who churned:
*  Had a low educational level.
*  Were single at the time.
*  Worked extra hours.
*  Worked in sales.

### Economic impact.

According to the Center of American Progress (CAP), the average turnover cost of employees based on their salary is:
* 16.1% for salaries below $30,000 a year.
* 19.7% for salaries below $50,000 a year.
* 20.4% for salaries below $75,000 a year.
* 21.4% for all cases (we will take this as more than 75k a year)

Based on this information the potential losses can be up to **$5,470,760 USD**.
