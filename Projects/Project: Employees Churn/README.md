# Employees churn.
This is a Classification ML problem in which I predict employees' churn based on features in the dataset. I made 3 iterations in total, refining the process to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. 

## Iteration #1: 
In this iteration the next actions were performed:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning
* Hypothesis testing
* Building the ML model (Decition Tree Classifier)
* Hyperparameter tunning

## Iteration #2: 
In this iteration the next actions were performed:
* Used the first's iteration data to improve the model
* Feature selection
* Balanced the target variable (churn, 0's and 1's)
* Building the ML model (Decition Tree Classifier)
* Hyperparameter tunning
* Confusion matrix visualization

## Iteration #3: 
In this iteration the next actions were performed:
* Used the second's iteration data to improve the model
* Balanced the target variable (churn, 0's and 1's)
* Building the ML model (This time I used a Random Forest Classifier since a DTC is more likely biased)
* Hyperparameter tunning
* Confusion matrix visualization
