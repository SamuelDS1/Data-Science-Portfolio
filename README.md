# [Project 1: Predicting Employees Churn](https://github.com/SamuelDS1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Projects/Project%201:%20Employees%20Churn) 
Employee churn, the phenomenon of employees leaving an organization, poses significant challenges for businesses in terms of productivity, morale, and financial implications. By leveraging the power of data, I have created a predictive model that effectively forecasts the likelihood of employees leaving a company.

Through data analysis, I have identified key factors that contribute to employee attrition, such as job satisfaction and compensation. By using decision trees, and random forests, I have developed a model that can anticipate employees churn with **90% precision**.

I performed data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation, and interpretation of results.
